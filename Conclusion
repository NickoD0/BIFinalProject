In conclusion, we have determined that the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh would be Oakland. 
It has the most widely used start and end POGOH stations which give students easy access to transportation around campus. 
From the Blocked pathways dataset, Troy hill would be the best place for biking. 
As even with a similar population it has significantly less blocked bike pathways.
