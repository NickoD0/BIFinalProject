In conclusion, we have determined that the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh would be Oakland. 
It has the most widely used start and end POGOH stations which give students easy access to transportation around campus. 
From the Blocked pathways dataset, The Central Business District would be the best place for biking. 
During the study, the Business district surprisingly only had 1 pathway blocked.  
Central Oakland has more POGOH docks than any other neighborhood, which makes sense, considering the sort of neighborhood it is,
as well as the college students. I don't really think I have a favorite neighborhood, but Oakland is pretty nice. In that sense, 
I think the metric did a good job.
